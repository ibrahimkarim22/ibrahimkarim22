# Hi there, I'm Ibrahim Karim! You can call me Jaime! 👋  

I'm a **Full-Stack Web & Mobile Developer** and **2D/3D Animator**.  
I build functional apps with **React, React Native, Firebase, Node.js** 
and create **hand-drawn 2D animations** using Toon Boom Harmony. I also can model a bit in 3D using Blender. 
All my animations and code are made **frame by frame, voice-acted, and edited by me** (no AI-generated shortcuts).
